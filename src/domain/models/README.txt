Models are like individual entities but are aggregrate
roots. They manage multiple sub-entities and coordinates
a process between them.

Example:
    - Model of a clock and how it works
    - Model of a Transaction between User, Stocks and Account
    - Model of some simulation processs (?)



Developers use the Model without having to thinker with
it's sub-process and/or sub-entities. Models manage it
all as 1 aggregrate root object.
