VIEWS IN SPA SETUP
------------------------------------------------------------
In an SPA setup (See: screens/SpaDemo), the screen is asssembled with
1 default View (see: views/). Add navigation to other views
using links with namespace to view:

<a href=#display.views.Home">Home Page</a>
<a href=#display.views.About">About Us</a>
<a href=#display.views.Contact">Contact Us</a>


Views are regular, but larger WebComponents that
are screen-sized. Different Views are navigated to,
using links above, without refreshing the Screen.
