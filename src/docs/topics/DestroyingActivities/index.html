        <p>
          We've been using the terms, Activity and Views interchangeably. "Views" were mentioned abstractly to mean a UI component appearing in an applications view-port. But how views transition in and out of a view-port is a design pattern in Arc called Activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Navigating to views by links:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#screens.BlackFridayDeals&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Black Friday Specials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>

            is a design decision that required an intelligent, real-time routing mechanism that limits any pre-configured "wire-ups". Developers leverage existing knowledge of simple anchros to achieve graceful navigation between views.
