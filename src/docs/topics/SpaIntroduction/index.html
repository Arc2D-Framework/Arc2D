        <h1 id="api-reference">SPA Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Single page applications (SPA), equate to having a single page that loads just once with views that transition and out without causing a browser reload. This is the "rough" idea of what and SPA is all about.

        <h1 id="api-reference">Application Redirects (reloadable)</h1>
        <p>
          Arc allows many SPA applications to co-exist with redirects between each other. For example, in an eCommerce front-end, it makes sense to have separate products catalog and user dashboard applications as distinct screens, since they may present different contexts and features, but existing within the same system. Redirecting to applications within the same front-end is simple:
            <!-- Every application in Arc is a single application. There can be
            many applications in the system, each isolated but may share resources. You never cram
            it all into 1 "spa". It makes sense to have a store-front application for example and
            a users dashboard application since they may present different contexts, layouts and navigation. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            To redirect from 1 application to another, use an href:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;dahsboard.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe there is a link back to shopping:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;products.html&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Catalog&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is essentially all you need to know to move between multiple SPA applications. Each provides a context, layout and menu. Once an application is running, there should never be a browser-refresh of any kind when moving between an applications views.

        <h1 id="api-reference">Transitionable Activity Views (no reloading)</h1>
        <p>
          Typically, an application will have several views to show, only 1 active
          view is seen at anytime. Applications designate an area on the screen, called a view-port, where views will transition in and out. Navigate between views using anchor-links:
        </p>
        <p>
            To navigate between views in an application, simply setup a #hash link:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#screens.BlackFridayDeals&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Black Friday Specials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Place the link anywhere within the app. When clicked, the <code>BlackFridayDeals</code> component will load into the applications designated view-port, (a <code>&#x3C;slot&#x3E;&#x3C;/slot&#x3E;</code>) that you specify as the "area" for views to transition in and out. The <code>#screens.BlackFridayDeals</code> is a fully qualified namespace to any component that serves as a view.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="width: 50%;display: block;">
        <div class="shell lang"></div>
        <div class="javascript lang"></div>
        <div class="html lang"></div>
        <div class="css lang"></div>
      </div>
    </div>




    <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;flex-wrap: nowrap;">
      <div style="width: 50%;padding: 22px;">
        <h1 id="api-reference">Component Views</h1>
        <p>
            The BlackFriday activity view is just another component setup no different. Snippets on the right.
            <pre class="inline javascript lang"><code>
namespace \`store.deals\` (
    class BlackFriday extends w3c.ui.WebComponent  {
        
    }
)</code></pre><br/>
<img src="src/docs/images/black_friday.png" style="width: 200px;">
            </p>
        <p>
            So a #hash link to this component (fully-qualified namespace) will cause the application to
            display it in the view-port.
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#screens.BlackFridayDeals&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Black Friday Specials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>

        <h1 id="api-reference">Activity life-cycle</h1>
        <p>
          There can only be one active and focused view that a user interacts with in an application. Generally these views are larger "screen-like" components that might be assembled with other smaller components. But only one view is ever the main focus. This concept in Arc is called an Activity with a life-cycle on their own. Let's have a look at what occurs when an Activity (view) begins and ends.
