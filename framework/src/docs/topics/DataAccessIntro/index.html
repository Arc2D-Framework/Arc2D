            Arc uses a clean-architecture, repository pattern, for working with data sources, such that high-level UI components never depend upon low-level devices. Instead, the UI works directly with domain driven Repositories and Models, an abstraction that forces out low-level device implementations into the Infastructure and exposes a supple Model for retrieving and storing data. When viewing an Arc application in layers, it should resemble:
            <img src="src/docs/images/data_access_repositories.png" style="margin-top:60px;"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The UI is independent of any particular storage devices and will not have to be changed when switching your database to another device, well, in theory. The changes will be isolated to the driver at an infastructure level that implements the protocols to communicate with that data source. 
        </p>

            Firebase, Mongo, CouchDB and Arango are all examples of remote No-SQL databases usually exposed as RESTFul end-point connections. Create drivers as needed that knows how to protocol with a data/storage platform.  Local XML and JSON files on disk are also sources of data. So is HTML5 localStorage and sessionStorage. Arc ships with a set of simple storage drivers that allows you to develope offline simply by using the built-in Session or Local storage drivers.

            Repositories are collections. Collections of object things like Songs, Artists,
            Movies, Users, Purchases and so on. Notice the pluralization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take Movies as an example. The Repository (Collection) for Movies
            is defined in the following way:
            <pre class="inline javascript lang">
                <code>
namespace \`core.data\` (
    class Movies extends core.data.Repository {
        @public device_driver = "core.drivers.storage.Memory";
    }
);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is configured here to use the Memory storage driver. When it is used
            by developers, they should not be concerned where data is being read/written
            to. The idea is that the <code>device_driver</code> could be switched to
            MongoDB or some other medium without developers having to alter application
            code they've written in any specific way for any specific devices.
