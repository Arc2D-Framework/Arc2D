        <h1 id="api-reference">SPA Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Single page applications (SPA), equate to having a single page that loads just once, having views that transition in and out without causing a browser reload. This is a "rough" idea of what an SPA is.

        <h1 id="api-reference">Application Redirects (reloadable)</h1>
        <p>
          Arc allows many SPA applications to co-exist with redirects between each other. For example, in an eCommerce front-end, it makes sense to have a separate <code>ProductsCatalog</code> and <code>UserAccount</code> applications as distinct screens, since they may present different contexts and features, but existing within the same system. Redirecting to applications within the same front-end is simple:
            <!-- Every application in Arc is a single application. There can be
            many applications in the system, each isolated but may share resources. You never cram
            it all into 1 "spa". It makes sense to have a store-front application for example and
            a users dashboard application since they may present different contexts, layouts and navigation. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            To redirect from 1 application to another, use an href:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;user-account.html&#x22;&#x3E;My Account&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe there is a link back to shopping:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;products-catalog.html&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Catalog&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is essentially all you need to know to move between multiple SPA applications. Each provides a context, layout and menu. Once an application is running, there should never be a browser-refresh of any kind when moving between an applications views.

        <h1 id="api-reference">Transitionable Activity Views (no reloading)</h1>
        <p>
          Typically, an application will have several views to show, only 1 active
          view is seen at anytime. Applications designate an area on the screen, called a view-port, where views will transition in and out. Navigate between views using anchor-links:
        </p>
        <p>
            To navigate between views in an application, simply setup a #hash link:
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#store.deals.BlackFriday&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Black Friday Specials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Place the link anywhere within the app. When clicked, the <code>BlackFriday</code> component will load into the applications designated view-port, (a <code>&#x3C;slot&#x3E;&#x3C;/slot&#x3E;</code>) that you specify as the "area" for views to transition in and out. The <code>#store.deals.BlackFriday</code> is a fully qualified namespace to any component.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="width: 50%;display: block;">
        <div class="shell lang"></div>
        <div class="javascript lang"></div>
        <div class="html lang"></div>
        <div class="css lang"></div>
      </div>
    </div>




    <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;flex-wrap: nowrap;">
      <div style="width: 50%;padding: 22px;">
        <h1 id="api-reference">Component Views</h1>
        <p>
            The BlackFriday activity view is just another component. Snippets on the right.
            <pre class="inline javascript lang"><code>
namespace \`store.deals\` (
    class BlackFriday extends WebComponent  {
        
    }
)</code></pre><br/>
<img src="docs/images/black_friday.png" style="width: 200px;">
            </p>
        <p>
            So a #hash link to this component (fully-qualified namespace) will cause the application to
            display it in the view-port.
            <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#store.deals.BlackFriday&#x22;&#x3E;Shop Black Friday Specials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre><br/>

        <h1 id="api-reference">Activity life-cycle</h1>
        <p>
          There can only be one active and focused view that a user interacts with in an application. Generally these views are larger "screen-like" components that might be assembled with other smaller components. But only one view is ever the main focus. This concept in Arc is called an Activity with a life-cycle on their own. Let's have a look at what occurs when an Activity (view) begins and ends.
