        <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p>
          The Arc Engine is a native, W3C compliant ES6/7 framework for
          building enterprise-class 2D/Applications. Over a decade
          old, Arc began as a personal R&D project to reduce and reuse
          repetetive UI patterns, cuttting time and costs as a consultant on 
          projects dating back to 2007. It has since evolved slowly across 
          many prestegious companies to present and has been used primilarily for 
          in-house internal applications. Arc is now going public.

        <h3>Framework vs. API</h3>
        <p>
          Arc is a framework. <em><strong>To put it in simple terms:</strong> A framework calls you, you do not call a framework -- as you would with an api.</em>
          Arc is a meta-prototype of a running, fully functional application
          designed into the kernel from birth, serving as an abstract application, able to run on it's own, autonomously, without supplying any additional code or directions until you wish to override. If you're familar
          with C++ or Java, the analogy can be likened to an Abstract Class,
          a barebones template able to be used but does nothing much until you supply 
          overridable implementation via inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In similar fashion, your application will inherit the Arc enging when
          embedded, where you supply overridable implementations to achieve results, or supply
          nothing and nothing happens. The internal workings and intricate hand-crafted details of inter-component-communication, life-cycle, collision, timing, physics, 
          state and work-flow in Arc are the processes that make up it's running "engine". Only
          aspects of the Arc engine (framework) can be swapped or supplied by you with overrides, allowing it to call your code, never you calling Arc's code as you would with APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference is clear. An API is a library of dedicated objects and methods around a finer domain, like api's for grandular I/O Disk or Network operations. Multiple APIs can be orchastrated to communicate with each other in a process that yields
          a framework eventually. 
        </p>

        <h3>Embedding</h3>
        <p>
          Embed Arc in any existing web page within the &#x3C;head&#x3E; tag:
          <pre class="inline html lang"><code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;script src=&#x22;node_modules/od-cocoon/framework.src.js&#x22; charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x3C;/head&#x3E;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The webpage should still function as it did before embedding Arc with no visual differences or added behaviors. At this point, the page is still a page, not an Application or World until you supply one.
          Of importance are these notes:
          <ul>
            <li>No WebPack</li>
            <li>No Build Scripts, No Grunt</li>
            <li>No Babel</li>
            <li>No Pre/Post Compilation stages (live and dynamic)</li>
            <li>No Configuration or Settings to alter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Arc interprets itself while running. It is live and direct, leveraging the dynamic nature of native ECMAScript/ES6 with standard HTML5 to accomplish sophisticated solutions with elegance, delegating most of the work to the browser. Powerful features are compressed
          into a kernel size of just @27kB (non-gzip). Built to run on NodeJS, Electron, Mobile (app store via Cordova or Capacitor) and the Web.
