        <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p>
          The Arc Engine is a native, W3C compliant ES6/7 framework for
          building enterprise-class 2D/Applications. Over a decade
          old, Arc began as a personal R&D project to reduce and reuse
          repetetive UI patterns, cuttting time and costs as a consultant on 
          projects dating back to 2007. It has since evolved slowly across 
          prestegious companies to present used for primilarily for 
          in-house internal applications. Arc is now going public.

        <h3>Framework vs. API</h3>
        <p>
          To put it simply: A framework calls you, you do not call a framework.
          Arc is a meta-prototype of a running, fully functional application
          designed into the kernel from birth, meaning, the framework, serves
          as an abstract application, able to run on it's own 
          autonomously without supplying any additional code until you wish to override. If you're familar
          with C++ or Java, the analogy can be likened to an Abstract Class,
          a barebones class-template able to be used but does nothing much until you supply 
          overrides via inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In similar fashion, your application will inherit the engine of Arc when
          embedded, where you supply bare minimum overrides to achieve results or supply
          nothing and nothing happens. The internal
          workings and intricate hand-crafted details of inter-communication, collision, timing, physics, 
          state and work-flow in Arc are the processes that make up it's running "engine". Only
          parts of the Arc engine (framework) can be swapped or supplied by you with overrides 
          that Arc depends on, allowing it to call your code, never you calling Arc's
          code as you would with APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference is clear. An API is a library of specialized, 
          dedicated objects and methods around a finer domain. Multiple APIs
          can be orchastrated to communicate in a process that yields
          a framework eventually.
