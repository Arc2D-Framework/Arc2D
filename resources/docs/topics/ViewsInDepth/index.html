          A view is a kind of activity being performed by the user. We'll use the terms, "view" and "activity", interchangeably. Usually there is
          a single activity in focus on a screen, but, as we'll cover later, multiple activities
          can be stacked vertically, horizontally and even on top of each other. But, generally, Single Page Applications (SPA), the architectural pattern for building rich applications, have, at most,
          a single screen with navigation between many views (activities) where only 1 view is ever visible within that screen without ever reloading the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only requirement for a screen to function as an SPA, is defining
            a &#x3C;slot&#x3E; on the screen that manages the transitioning of views
            that come into view and swap out of view for another view:
            <pre class="inline html lang">
                <code>
&#x3C;slot name=&#x22;content&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/slot&#x3E;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The above is all that is required to enable SPA navigation on your screen.
            Here's an example of a screen having a nav and a slot for showing
            the views declared by the anchor tags:
            <pre class="inline html lang">
                <code>
&#x3C;body namespace=&#x22;display.screens.HelloWorld&#x22;&#x3E;
   &#x3C;hello-world&#x3E;
       &#x3C;template&#x3E;
           &#x3C;nav&#x3E;
               &#x3C;a href=&#x22;#display.views.Home&#x22;&#x3E;Home&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
               &#x3C;a href=&#x22;#display.views.Dashboard&#x22;&#x3E;Dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
               &#x3C;a href=&#x22;#display.views.About&#x22;&#x3E;About&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
           &#x3C;/nav&#x3E;
           &#x3C;slot name=&#x22;content&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/slot&#x3E;
       &#x3C;/template&#x3E;
   &#x3C;/hello-world&#x3E;
&#x3C;/body&#x3E;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <div class="shell lang"></div>
        <div class="javascript lang"></div>
        <div class="html lang"></div>
        <div class="css lang"></div>

    <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;flex-wrap: nowrap;">
      <div style="width: 50%;padding: 22px;">

            The layout above shows a screen with several areas. The content area is the
            slot that will be filled with a View. Maybe the view is loaded from a link in the navigation,
            maybe from the sidebar or footer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Declare the layout of your screen however you wish, with whatever markup that makes the most sense, assemble it with components such as depicted above, and declare a blank slot to achieve the basis
            of an SPA.
