### At 10KB/1400 Lines of Code (LOC). Ultra efficient on mobile, desktop and web devices. Low memory (RAM) footprint and small kernel size puts Arc2D at a solid advantage. 

## Arc2D Framework 🦏
The Arc2D Framework - An Agnostic, W3C ES6/7 Vanilla JavaScript Compliant 2D World & GUI Engine used
for building enterprise-class 2D, Web and Mobile Applications.

## Zero Config Setup 📁
Getting started is easy, add 1 line to your HTML **`<head>`** tag to run the framework.
Clone from this repository and follow the instructions to get started, visit https://www.arc2d.com/resources/doc
for Arc2D's full documentation.

## Multi-App SPA 🎇
Build multi-connected SPA apps in the same container that load and cache better than React, Angular & Vue.

## Progressive Enhancement 🖌️
Stealthfully decorate & enhance existing/legacy pages with Arc, 1 component at a time without altering
any existing HTML. 

## No Compilers 🚫
No Webpack, Grunt, Babel, Pre or Post Processors needed. Optional dependencies vary on the developer.

## SDK Tools 🛠️
Arc comes equipped with its own internal build generator which will stitch and seam together multiple
apps using the Prefab SDK tools.

## Quartz Loop 🔁
Time sensitive simulation of physics, collision and AI with input, update and render sequence
at an fixed update.

## W3C Web Components ⚙️
Build true native WebComponents and assemble them on screen following W3C's recommendation.

## Namespace Management 🗂️
Like Java packages, organize complex applications in a folder structure you choose that
mirrors namespaces.

## Data Binding 🖧
Data bind a DOMNode on screen to a class member variable in JavaScript for synchronization
of values in both directions. 

## Agnostic HTML Templating 🌐
Plug-in your engine of choice (Mustache, Nunjucks, Handlebars & more). No vendor lock-in
to technologies like React's JSX.

## Native ES6/7 ❤️‍🔥
Native ES6/7 without builds. Runs live in NodeJS, Electrton and Cordova/Capacitor. 

## SPA Architecture ✨
Framework managed SPA architecture. Intuitive, seamless and transparent, no "Router"
mechanisms or API's to fiddle with.

## Auto-Nav (for SPA) ⚡️
The Auto-Nav feature handles navigation between multiple "views" or apps of an SPA using
traditional links in dot notation mirroring namespace folder structure. 

## Tweens 💥
Tween or animate any object with HTML5 and JavaScript properties.

## Layered Canvas 📊
Layer HTML, SVG and native Canvas together to build rich HUDs.

## Component Cascade 🧮
Components auto-cascade their CSS in the right order automatically. 

## A* Path Finding 📐
2D path finder resolves best path to target on tilemaps with walls/obstacles in the way.

## Agnostic Data Storage 🗄️
Mongo-like API with swappable data storage drivers for local and remote connectivity.

## State Machine 🎮
Transition between modes (views) of gameplay with little effort.
(Example: Splash to Menu ➡️ Level to Game ➡️ Menu to Level).

## FPS Control 🚄
Frame dropping and interpolation for smooth animation during lags, lockstep or
slow device spikes. 

## Collisions ☄️
SAT engine resolves collisions between any convex shapes on Canvas, HTML or SVG.

## 2D Physics 🌟
Box2D ready, stepped at a fixed physics update by Arcs quartz loop.

## Heroku Ready 🚀
**git push heroku master** for deployment.
